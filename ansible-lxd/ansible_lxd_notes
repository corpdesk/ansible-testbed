Based on ansible-tesbed/ansible-cd:
- This project assumes an lxd cluster has already been setup.
- confirm that newly created containers can ping each other
- Use the hosts.json to create lxd containers:
    - populate hosts.json is based on https://github.com/georemo/kubernetes-hard-way-ansible.git
    - at the moment we dont have controll over new lxd ips so the ip fields can be done after creation of containers
- for each host:
    - check if expected container exists
    - if container_not_exist(), then, create_container(hostname)
- update hosts.json with ips:
    - currently done manually
    - should be automated
- check connectivity:
    - check connectivity via ping (name and ip)
    - check ssh connectivity (name and ip)
- iniitial actions on deployer:
    - do initial installations for deployer
    - install ansible
    - do ssh-copy from deployer
    - confirm ansible ping
    - confirm ansible sudo actions is possible
    - review ansible host.ini file in view of new ips, expected ansible user

- on each host(ssh):
    - create initial user
    - setup ssh connectivity
    - install necessary apps (git,net-tools etc)
    - 

- on deployer:
    - install ansible
    - git clone https://github.com/georemo/ansible-testbed
    - git clone https://github.com/georemo/kubernetes-hard-way-ansible.git
    - test ssh
    - test ansible
    - run https://github.com/georemo/kubernetes-hard-way-ansible.git
