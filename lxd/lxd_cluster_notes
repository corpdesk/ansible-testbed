# If you configured your cluster to use authentication tokens, you must generate a join token for each new member. 
# To do so, run the following command on an existing cluster member (for example, the bootstrap server):

lxc cluster add <new_member_name>


# If, retrying a failed join attempt:
#     Error: Failed to join cluster: This server is already clustered
# then:
lxd sql local "DELETE FROM raft_nodes;"
lxd sql local "DELETE FROM config;"
# End if

## Recover from quorum loss

# Every LXD cluster has a specific number of members (configured through cluster.max_voters) that serve as voting members of the distributed database. If you permanently lose a majority of these cluster members (for example, you have a three-member cluster and you lose two members), the cluster loses quorum and becomes unavailable. However, if at least one database member survives, it is possible to recover the cluster.

# To do so, complete the following steps:
#     Log on to any surviving member of your cluster and run the following command:

      sudo lxd cluster list-database

#     This command shows which cluster members have one of the database roles.
#     Pick one of the listed database members that is still online as the new leader. Log on to the machine (if it differs from the one you are already logged on to).
#     Make sure that the LXD daemon is not running on the machine. For example, if you’re using the snap:

      sudo snap stop lxd

#     Log on to all other cluster members that are still online and stop the LXD daemon.
#     On the server that you picked as the new leader, run the following command:

      sudo lxd cluster recover-from-quorum-loss

#     Start the LXD daemon again on all machines, starting with the new leader. For example, if you’re using the snap:

      sudo snap start lxd

# The database should now be back online. No information has been deleted from the database. All information about the cluster members that you have lost is still there, including the metadata about their instances. This can help you with further recovery steps if you need to re-create the lost instances.

# To permanently delete the cluster members that you have lost, force-remove them. See Delete cluster members.
